# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2020-06-20
- Initial build. Not much functionality available until Rojo's two-way sync API is more fleshed out.
- Properties panel. Not 100% reliable yet and no way to modify anything. Just for looks for now.
- Explorer panel. Context menu entries for instances do nothing.
- Support for opening & saving Scripts, LocalScripts, and ModuleScripts as long as they aren't part of a .rbxm
- Support for custom icons. Absolute path must be set in extension configuration. Icons must be exact class name & end in .png
